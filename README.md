# AGS-Physics-Framework
The AGS Physics Framework is a specialized computational toolkit designed to bridge theoretical high-energy physics with observational cosmology. It focuses on the AGS (Alpha-Gaussian-Scalar) potential, a model used to explain cosmic inflation while remaining consistent with satellite data.
